# UK Water Level Prediction Dashboard

This project is a Streamlit-based dashboard developed for predicting **weekly reservoir water levels in the United Kingdom** using machine learning models.

The system allows users to:
- Upload reservoir data
- Train prediction models
- Generate future water level forecasts
- Visualise results interactively

## Models Used

- **Random Forest** (tree-based machine learning model)
- **LSTM Neural Network** (deep learning time-series model)
- **Ensemble Forecast** (average of both models)

---

## Main Features

- Weekly time-series forecasting
- Interactive visualisation using Plotly
- Model performance evaluation
- Uncertainty bounds for predictions
- Export forecast results to CSV
- Feature importance using SHAP (if installed)
